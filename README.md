# dice-rolling-game

## Game Logic

- 2 players game. Each player can roll the dice 5 times. If a user roll 1 he loose 1 chance extra. If a user roll 6 he get 1 chance bonus. After the rolling of both player, who has more score will won. If both users has same score then the match will be drawn. (Score will be represented by Dice!)

### Ui planning

- Need something to showcase 2 players
- Need somethig to inform how many chances are left
- Need something to give a message when user roll 6 or 1
- Need something to show the current score
- Need something to show the total score
- Need something to display the result
